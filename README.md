# Wx1 - CMake #

Created a copy of Pauls test repo, looking to get a Cake working for each project to see if I can create something that will translate between what's been done to date and Pauls planned content for the module. 

## Known Issues ##

* OpenGL issue may relate to graphics drivers, or perhaps some recent changes to EGL. 
* RC files on Linux hasn't been explored.
